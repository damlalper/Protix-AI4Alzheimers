## 🧬 Project Motivation

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology and limited treatment options. Early detection and targeted drug development are critical. **Protix** aims to:

1. Predict the 3D structure of AD-related proteins (Amyloid-beta, Tau) using AI-based protein modeling.
2. Simulate protein-ligand interactions to identify promising drug candidates.
3. Provide **explainable AI insights** to guide biomedical research and hypothesis generation.

By integrating multiple computational approaches, **Protix** provides a research-grade tool that could accelerate therapeutic discovery.
